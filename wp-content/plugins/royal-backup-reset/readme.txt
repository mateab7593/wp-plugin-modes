WordPress backup plugin to create full website backups and restore them easily, smart pre-update backup reminders, built-in database reset tool and more!

== Description ==

Royal Backup & Restore is a powerful and **easy-to-use** WordPress backup plugin that helps you protect your website by creating full site backups, database backups, and automatic scheduled backups in just a few clicks. Whether you want to secure your website from crashes, plugin conflicts, hacking attempts, or update failures, this plugin ensures your WordPress site can always be **restored quickly and safely**.

Unlike other WordPress backup plugins, Royal Backup includes a **unique smart** backup reminder system that **automatically prompts** you to create a backup before updating plugins, themes, or installing new ones — preventing accidental data loss.

With Royal Backup, you can create complete WordPress backups including database, plugins, themes, uploads, and wordpress core files (PRO version), then restore your website instantly with one-click restore. The plugin also supports automatic backup scheduling (PRO version), allowing you to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly backups without manual effort.

You can also securely store backups in **cloud storage** (PRO version) such as Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon S3, manage multiple backup locations, and perform selective backup and restore operations. Additionally, the built-in database reset tool lets you instantly reset WordPress to a fresh state without reinstalling.

* **Backup Core Wordpress Files** - Backup all core WordPress files including wp-admin, wp-includes, and essential root files such as wp-config.php, .htaccess, and more. If something damages or alters these core files — such as viruses, hacker attacks, plugin updates, theme changes, or WordPress updates — you can always revert and restore the original WordPress files.
* **Schedule Backups** - Schedule backup to run every 1 hour, 12 hours, daily, weekly, once every two weeks and monthly. So you can ‘set and forget’ about Backups. Backup Schedule can be configured for Files and databases separately.
* **Google Drive Cloud Backup** - Store backups securely on Google Drive. One Click Configuration.
* **Dropbox Cloud Backup** - Store backups securely on Dropbox. One Click Configuration.
* **Amazon S3 Cloud Backup** - Store backups securely on Amazon S3. Other Popular Cloud Backup Providers.
* **Save Backups in multiple locations simultaneously. ** - Backups can be created and saved simultaneously on your wordpress site and on Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon S3) as well. If one Backup location fails, you'll still have the option to restore or download from the others.
* **Backup Retention** - Automatically delete older backups to save disk space while retaining recent ones — with full control over how many backups to keep.
* **Selective Backup** - Choose specific components to backup — such as the database, plugins, themes, WordPress core files, or uploads — individually.
* **Selective Restore** - Choose specific components to restore - such as the database, plugins, themes, WordPress core files, or uploads — individually.
* **Backup Rename** - Rename your backups to improve identification, organization, and management.
* **Customizable Defaults** - Save your preferred Wordpress backup and restore settings as defaults — so you don’t need to preselect them every time you perform a backup or restore.
* **Incremental Backups (Coming Soon)** - Backup only the files and folders that have changed since your last backup, saving both time and storage space.
* **Wordpress Multisite Network Support (Coming Soon)** - Full support for WordPress Multisite networks, all Wordpress Multisite files and databases will be stored in the backup.
* **Clear Uploads Directory** - Perform a full cleanup of the uploads folder during a database reset for a completely fresh start.
* **Priority Support** - Get direct support from the developers whenever you need help with your backups.


= Use Cases =

* **Regular Backups** - Manually create backups of your WordPress site and give them name.
* **Development & Testing** - Reset your WordPress database for testing or development purposes. This process deletes all files, settings, and posts — giving you a fresh WordPress installation without needing to reinstall WordPress manually. If you're a tester, you can also create predefined testing backups. For example, create a backup named "Test 1" with pre-installed plugins or themes you frequently use. Or create a backup named "Astra Theme – Template Imported", where an Astra theme template is already imported — so you can instantly restore your preferred setup from backups without having to re-import everything.
* **Pre-Update Safety** - Sometimes we forget to create a backup before updating plugins or themes, or when installing new ones. Our smart notification system reminds you to create a backup before these potentially risky actions.
* **Only Database Backup** - If you're creating new content daily on your WordPress website — such as posts, pages, and more — you can choose to backup only the database, saving significant storage space. Full file backups can be performed less frequently, such as once per week.
* **Only File Backups** - If you only want to backup specific WordPress files without the database, you can do so and restore them whenever needed.
* **Only Wordpress Core files Backup** - Securely backup your WordPress core files and easily restore them if they become damaged — for example, by viruses or caching plugins that modify critical files like .htaccess and wp-config.php.
* **Automatic Schedule Backups** - Our backup plugin will automatically create backups in the background while you work on your WordPress website.
